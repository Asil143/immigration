    {
      question: "Can I work on an F-1 visa?",
      answer:
        "On-campus employment is allowed up to 20 hours/week during classes, 40 hours during breaks. Off-campus work requires authorization (CPT or OPT). Unauthorized work is a severe violation that can result in deportation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the grace period after graduation?",
      answer:
        "F-1 students get a 60-day grace period after their program end date (or OPT end date) to leave the US, transfer schools, or change status.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I travel outside the US on F-1?",
      answer:
        "Yes, with a valid visa stamp and travel signature on your I-20 (from your DSO, valid 6 months). Your visa stamp must be valid to re-enter; if expired, you'll need to apply for a new one abroad.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I drop below full-time enrollment?",
      answer:
        "Dropping below full-time without DSO authorization violates your F-1 status. Contact your DSO before dropping classes. Exceptions exist for final semester, medical reasons, and academic difficulty (with DSO approval).",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between CPT and OPT?",
      answer:
        "Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is off-campus work authorized by your DSO that's directly tied to your curriculum, like a required internship, and must be used before you graduate. Optional Practical Training (OPT) is employment authorization from USCIS related to your major that can be used before or after graduation and isn't tied to a specific class. Using 12 months or more of full-time CPT makes you ineligible for OPT, so use it carefully.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer schools while on F-1?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You'll need to be accepted at the new school, then work with your current DSO to set a SEVIS transfer release date. Your SEVIS record moves to the new school on that date, and you must enroll there by the next available term, generally within 5 months of the release date, to stay in status.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my status if I change my major or degree level?",
      answer:
        "Changing your major at the same degree level is usually just an update your DSO makes to your existing SEVIS record. Moving to a new degree level, like bachelor's to master's, typically requires a new I-20 and SEVIS record. Talk to your DSO before the change so there's no gap in your enrollment history.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I go part-time in my final semester?",
      answer:
        "Yes, your DSO can authorize a reduced course load if you only need a few remaining credits or one class to complete your degree in your final term. You must get this approved before dropping below full-time, and it only applies to your actual final semester of study.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can my spouse and children join me on F-2 status?",
      answer:
        "Yes, your spouse and unmarried children under 21 can get F-2 dependent visas. F-2 spouses cannot work but may study part-time; F-2 children can attend K-12 school full-time. If your spouse wants to study full-time themselves, they generally need their own F-1 status instead.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I work remotely for a foreign employer while on F-1?",
      answer:
        "This is a gray area USCIS hasn't clearly addressed, but most DSOs advise that if you're physically present in the US, working for any employer, even a foreign one paying into a foreign bank account, counts as unauthorized employment unless it's covered by CPT or OPT. Talk to your DSO before starting any remote work arrangement.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does academic probation or dismissal affect my F-1 status?",
      answer:
        "Academic probation alone usually doesn't end your status as long as you remain enrolled full-time, but you should notify your DSO. Academic dismissal does end your F-1 status: your SEVIS record gets terminated, and you generally have a short window to depart, transfer, or appeal, so contact your DSO immediately if this happens.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stay in the US between finishing one program and starting a new one?",
      answer:
        "Often, yes. This is sometimes called 'bridge' or 'gap' status. If you're continuing to a higher degree level at the same or a different school without a break longer than the annual vacation, your DSO can keep your SEVIS record active as 'Continuing' instead of issuing a new I-20 with a gap, which helps you avoid triggering the 60-day grace period.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does SEVIS termination mean, and can it be fixed?",
      answer:
        "SEVIS termination means SEVP has ended your active F-1 record, usually due to a violation like unauthorized work, failing to enroll full-time, or a criminal issue. A terminated record means you're immediately out of status. Depending on the reason, you may be able to file for reinstatement with USCIS, but talk to your DSO and an immigration attorney right away.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I travel while my SEVIS transfer is pending?",
      answer:
        "It's risky. Between your transfer release date and enrollment at the new school, you may not have a current travel signature valid for the new school, and CBP officers can question your intent to return to study. Most DSOs recommend avoiding international travel during an active transfer unless the new school's DSO has already issued a signed I-20 and travel signature before you leave.",
    },
