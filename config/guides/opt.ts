    {
      question: "How many days can I be unemployed during OPT?",
      answer:
        "Standard OPT: maximum 90 days total unemployment. STEM OPT: maximum 150 days total (including time unemployed during standard OPT). Exceeding this limit violates your F-1 status.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does freelancing or self-employment count for OPT?",
      answer:
        "Self-employment is allowed on standard OPT if you are working in your field of study. Self-employment is NOT allowed on STEM OPT — your employer must be an E-Verify enrolled company.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if my OPT application is still pending when my program ends?",
      answer:
        "If you applied on time (before program end) and have a USCIS receipt notice, you are in a 180-day cap-gap bridge until your EAD arrives or is denied. Check your receipt notice date carefully.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do OPT again after completing a second or higher degree?",
      answer:
        "Yes. OPT eligibility resets each time you complete a new, higher educational level — for example, bachelor's then master's, or master's then PhD. You generally cannot use standard OPT twice at the same degree level, but a new degree at a higher level unlocks a fresh 12-month OPT period.",
    },
    {
      question: "What counts as a qualifying STEM degree?",
      answer:
        "Your degree must appear on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program list, identified by its CIP (Classification of Instructional Programs) code. This code is printed on your I-20 under your degree information. Check the current list on the ICE Study in the States website — some fields you might expect to qualify (like general business) don't, while others are more inclusive than you'd guess.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get a second STEM OPT extension?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but only two STEM OPT extensions are allowed in your lifetime, and each must be based on a different, STEM-qualifying degree — you can't get two extensions off the same degree. So a student who used a STEM extension after a bachelor's degree could potentially use a second one after completing a qualifying STEM master's or PhD.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often do I need to report while on STEM OPT?",
      answer:
        "You must validate your information in the SEVP Portal (or with your DSO) every 6 months, even if nothing has changed. Separately, any material change — new employer, address, or a reduction to fewer than 20 hours/week — must be reported within 10 days of the change.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I miss a reporting deadline?",
      answer:
        "Missing the 6-month validation or a 10-day change report can lead your DSO to terminate your SEVIS record for a status violation, which immediately ends your work authorization. If you realize you missed a deadline, contact your DSO right away — catching up quickly, before SEVIS is flagged, is usually your best option.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I travel internationally while on OPT or STEM OPT?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but it carries real risk, especially with a pending application or after a gap in employment. See our full Travel Advisory guide for what documents to carry and when travel is safe.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does volunteer or unpaid work count toward my OPT employment requirement?",
      answer:
        "It can, as long as it's bona fide work in your field of study, at least 20 hours/week, and you can document it (an offer letter, supervisor confirmation, or organizational verification). Unpaid internships that wouldn't legally require pay for a non-immigrant worker can qualify too — but work invented just to stop the unemployment clock does not.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a minimum number of hours I need to work on OPT?",
      answer:
        "Yes — you need to average at least 20 hours per week for the work to count as qualifying employment and avoid accruing unemployment days. You can combine multiple part-time jobs to reach 20 hours/week, as long as all of them relate to your field of study.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change employers while on OPT or STEM OPT?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Your EAD is not tied to a specific employer, so you don't need a new EAD to switch jobs. Just report the change to your DSO within 10 days. On STEM OPT specifically, a new employer means a new I-983 Training Plan and the new employer must also be E-Verify enrolled.",
    },
