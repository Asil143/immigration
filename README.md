## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root with the following:

```bash
# Clerk — https://dashboard.clerk.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding

# Supabase — https://supabase.com/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# Anthropic — https://console.anthropic.com
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Resend — https://resend.com/api-keys
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Database Setup

Run the migration file against your Supabase project. In the Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** and paste the contents of:

```
lib/supabase/migrations.sql
```

This creates the following tables:
- `profiles` — extended user data synced from Clerk
- `chat_conversations` — AI chat history per user
- `form_submissions` — USCIS form guide responses
- `community_posts` — Community Q&A posts
- `payment_submissions` — Manual payment records (pending / activated / rejected)
- `user_plans` — Activated plan records after admin approval

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase project
- A Clerk application
- An Anthropic API key
- A Resend account

### Local development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Other commands

```bash
npm run build   # Production build
npm run start   # Start production server
npm run lint    # ESLint
```

---

## Payments

VisaPilot uses a **manual payment flow** — no Stripe checkout required:

1. User selects a plan on `/pricing` or `/settings`
2. A modal shows payment handles (Cash App `$AsilKamepalli`, PayPal, Venmo, Chime, Zelle)
3. User pays and uploads a screenshot via the modal
4. Submission is saved to `payment_submissions` and an email notification is sent
5. Admin reviews at `/admin/payments` and activates the plan, which writes to `user_plans`
6. The sidebar and `/api/user/plan` read `user_plans` to show the correct plan badge

---

## Cron Jobs

A Vercel Cron runs daily at 9 AM UTC:

```
GET /api/cron/deadline-alerts
```

Configured in `vercel.json`. It sends deadline reminder emails to users with upcoming immigration milestones via Resend.

---

## Key Conventions

- **`createAdminClient()` is synchronous** — do not `await` it. It returns a Supabase client with the service role key.
- **Clerk `useUser()`** provides the authenticated user on the client. For server-side auth use `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`.
- **Navigation is defined in `config/navigation.ts`** — add or remove sidebar/navbar items there, not inline in components.
- **Shared UI components** live in `components/ui/` (shadcn/ui) and `components/payments/` (PaymentModal).
