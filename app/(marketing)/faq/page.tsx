    category: "About StatusClock",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What is StatusClock?",
        a: "StatusClock is a free immigration information platform for international students and professionals in the U.S. We provide step-by-step checklists, an AI assistant, deadline tracking, and plain-language guides covering F-1, OPT, STEM OPT, H-1B, J-1, and Green Card pathways.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is StatusClock a law firm or immigration attorney service?",
        a: "No. StatusClock is an information and tools platform — not a law firm. We do not provide legal advice, and using StatusClock does not create an attorney-client relationship. For case-specific guidance, especially if you've received an RFE, NOID, or any government notice, always consult a licensed immigration attorney.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is StatusClock free to use?",
        a: "Yes — core tools including all visa checklists, the OPT day counter, and the timeline tracker are free with no sign-up required. The AI Assistant and some premium features require a free account. We offer paid plans for advanced features like document generation and priority support.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need to create an account?",
        a: "Not for basic use. Checklists, guides, and several tools are accessible without signing in. Creating a free account lets you save your checklist progress, sync across devices, and access the AI Assistant.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "OPT & STEM OPT",
    items: [
      {
        q: "When should I apply for OPT?",
        a: "You can apply up to 90 days before your program end date and no later than 60 days after. USCIS recommends applying as early as possible since processing can take 3–5 months. Your EAD card must arrive before you can start working.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does OPT last?",
        a: "Standard post-completion OPT is 12 months. If you have a qualifying STEM degree and your employer is E-Verify enrolled, you can apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension, giving you up to 36 months total.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if USCIS doesn't process my OPT before my graduation date?",
        a: "You have a 60-day grace period after your program end date. As long as your OPT application was filed before your grace period ended and while you were in valid F-1 status, you remain in valid status while the application is pending. You just can't work until the EAD arrives.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need a job offer to apply for OPT?",
        a: "No — you can apply for OPT without a job offer. However, you must be employed or actively seeking employment during OPT. If you are unemployed for more than 90 cumulative days during standard OPT (or 150 days during STEM OPT), you may fall out of status.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the STEM OPT reporting requirement?",
        a: "During STEM OPT, you must submit validation reports to your DSO every 6 months confirming your employment and training. Your employer must also complete a Formal Training Plan (I-983). Failure to report on time can jeopardize your status.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "H-1B Visa",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What is the H-1B cap lottery?",
        a: "Each year, USCIS receives far more H-1B petitions than the 85,000 visas available (65,000 regular cap + 20,000 for U.S. master's degree holders). USCIS runs a random lottery to select petitions. Registration typically opens in March for an October 1 start date.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I work while my H-1B is pending?",
        a: "If you are currently on OPT or STEM OPT and your H-1B is filed before your OPT expires with an October 1 start date, you are covered under 'cap-gap' protection. This extends your OPT authorization until October 1, allowing you to keep working.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is an H-1B transfer?",
        a: "If you are already in H-1B status with one employer and want to change jobs, your new employer files an H-1B transfer (also called a 'portability' petition). You can start working for the new employer as soon as the petition is filed — you don't have to wait for approval.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long can I stay on H-1B?",
        a: "Initial H-1B approval is for up to 3 years, with one extension of up to 3 more years (6 years total). Beyond 6 years, extensions are possible if you have an approved I-140 petition or a pending PERM labor certification that is more than 365 days old.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is an RFE and what should I do if I receive one?",
        a: "An RFE (Request for Evidence) is a notice from USCIS asking for more documentation to support your petition. You typically have 87 days to respond. An RFE is not a denial — respond thoroughly with your attorney's help. StatusClock's RFE Assistant can help you understand common RFE types.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Green Card",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What is the EB-2 vs EB-3 category?",
        a: "EB-2 is for professionals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability. EB-3 is for skilled workers, professionals, and unskilled workers. EB-2 generally has shorter wait times for most countries. Indian and Chinese nationals face extremely long backlogs in both categories due to per-country annual limits.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is PERM labor certification?",
        a: "PERM (Program Electronic Review Management) is the first step in most employer-sponsored green card cases. Your employer must conduct a supervised job search to prove no qualified U.S. workers are available for the role. The process typically takes 8–18 months.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is priority date and why does it matter?",
        a: "Your priority date is typically the date USCIS receives your I-140 petition (or the PERM filing date). The Visa Bulletin published monthly by the State Department shows which priority dates are 'current' — meaning a visa number is available and you can proceed with adjustment of status.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I change jobs while my green card is pending?",
        a: "Yes, under AC21 portability, if your I-485 has been pending for 180+ days, you can change to a 'same or similar' job without jeopardizing your green card case. Consult an attorney before doing so, as the analysis is fact-specific.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Account & Billing",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How do I delete my account?",
        a: "You can delete your account from your account settings page. All personal data will be permanently deleted within 30 days per our Privacy Policy. Paid subscriptions should be cancelled first to avoid future charges.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I get a refund?",
        a: "All purchases are final and non-refundable unless required by law. If you believe you were charged in error, contact us at support@statusclock.com within 14 days of the charge.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my data secure?",
        a: "Yes. We use TLS encryption in transit and AES-256 encryption at rest. Authentication is handled by Clerk, a dedicated security-focused auth provider. We never store credit card details on our servers — payments go through Stripe. See our Privacy Policy for full details.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use StatusClock on mobile?",
        a: "Yes — StatusClock is fully responsive and works on mobile browsers. A dedicated mobile app is on our roadmap.",
